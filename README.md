# Tools
Useful scripts and devtools I've built to make things easier/faster. 

* **Scaffold.js**: For vanilla JS projects. Standsup a basic project structure with a handful of typical packages, like Jest, ESLint, and Webpack. Includes configs for these as well, including the conversion config for Jest to use ES modules instead of CommonJS.
