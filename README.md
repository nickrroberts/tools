# Tools
Useful scripts and devtools I've built to make things easier/faster. 

* **Scaffold.js**: Node script to scaffold vanilla JS projects. Stands up a basic project structure with a handful of typical packages, like Jest, ESLint, and Webpack. Includes configs for these as well, including the conversion config for Jest to use ES modules instead of CommonJS. 

* **gh-deploy.sh**: Bash script to automate my workflow copying builds from dist to the root of a gh-pages branch. Handy for smaller projects with no database and static pages.
